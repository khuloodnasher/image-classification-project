## Introduction
### Define the Problem

Disease diagnosis with radiology is a common practice in medicine  but requires doctors to interpret the results from the x-ray images. Due to the increase in the number of patients and the low availability of doctors, there was a need for a new method to diagnose .
Fortunately machine learning has introduced the solution for this problem . In this project we are going to introduce deep learning models and techniques in diagnosing pneumonia.
Through this project, we applied deep learning CNN techniques in image classification and we followed the data science methodlogy as follows:
