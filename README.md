## Introduction
### Define the Problem

Disease diagnosis with radiology is a common practice in medicine  but requires doctors to interpret the results from the x-ray images. Due to the increase in the number of patients and the low availability of doctors, there was a need for a new method to diagnose .
Fortunately machine learning has introduced the solution for this problem . In this project we are going to introduce deep learning models and techniques in diagnosing pneumonia.

## Profitable Microsoft Studios Analysis By: Khulood Nasher 
In an effort by Microsoft to diversify its investments, they decided to invest in the film industry, and since Microsoft is keen on implementing its plans professionally, they have decided to employ a data scientist  whose job is to explore the data of the movie industry, analyze it and set recommendations based on the outcomes of the analysis.
The data scientist conducted a comprehensive analysis of the movie's data and set a couple of recommendations to what types of movies could be profitable at the box office. The data scientists set the findings based on many factors such as the genre, the season, the production budget, and the length of the movie. The data scientist ended up with  informative visualized recommendations for the executive director of Microsoft.

The following Questions were addressed: 

1- How has the movie industry changed in the last decade from 2008-2018?

2- What production budget range is more profitable for movies?

3- Which season is the most profitable?

4- What are the most successful genres?

5- Which genre is the most profitable for each season?

6- Does the runtime have any effect on the popularity of the genre?

## Data Sources: 
The data was collected from the following github repository:
